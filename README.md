# Matching Card Game üçΩÔ∏è

A 12 card memory game - the user selects two cards and check if they are a match. They can keep track of their score and level up for every 12 cards they match, or they can reset the game whenever.

## How It's Made
The appplication mainly focuses on using OOP to execute the code. Using six methods, the computer starts by shuffling the deck each game, and once the player chooses a card it verifies the move to be valid (not the same two cards being chosen), then the computer checks for a card match or a completely matched deck (12 cards). The user can choose to reset the game whenever, or they can keep playing and for every card they flip their score is tracked and for every deck they complete they can level up.

## What I Learned
Because a matching card game relies on repetitive actions, using OOP for this program was a really efficient way to execute it. Using OOP made creating the basic functionality of this application super fast and I also realized how much cleaner it made my code. In the end, it gave me more time to focus on the nitpicky aspects like making sure the program won't break if the user tries to mess around with it (ex. in my earlier version when the user quickly clicked on a third card while the second card was being flipped, the cards would freeze up and not register properly). Overall, I'm very proud of this application!
